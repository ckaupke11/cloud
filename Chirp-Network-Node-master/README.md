# Chirp Social Network NodeJS

- In this lab we will be developing a small Twitter clone called Chirp! in NodeJS.
- All of the code setup has been taken care of for you already, but you will need to set up your development environment to run the project:

##### Install node:

- Visit the [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install using the installer.

##### Install software dependencies (make sure you are in the project directory):

```bash
npm start
```

> Now you should be able to visit your site at http://localhost:3000
